# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains a simple C++ program to solve a Sudoku puzzle.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver.git
    ```

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, if you have the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) installed, you can use the command:

    ```shell
    g++ sudoku.cpp -o sudoku
    ```

3. Run the executable file:

    ```shell
    ./sudoku
    ```

4. Enter the Sudoku grid when prompted. Each row of the grid should be entered as space-separated numbers. For empty cells, enter '0'.

5. The program will print the entered grid and solve the Sudoku puzzle.

## Example

For example, consider the following Sudoku grid:

```
5 0 0 0 1 7 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 0 8 4 9
0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0
0 1 0 4 0 0 5 6 0
6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 7
7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 5
```

Enter the numbers row by row, separated by spaces. Press Enter after completing each row.

Afterwards, the program will print the entered grid and solve the Sudoku puzzle.
